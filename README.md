Word Frequency analyzer

Requirements:
Create text analyzer that processes text and provides information about its word contents.
One thing it should be able to support is the ability to create a report that shows a count
of how many times each word occurs in the text. The report should be sorted, with a
primary sort of word length, and a secondary ASCII sort.

The code should be production quality and written as if it were part of a utility
library.

Extra credit given for solutions that do not rely on Java Collections.

Example:

Input:
The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy brown dog’s back

Output:
1 The
1 fox
1 the
1 back
1 lazy
1 over
2 brown
1 dog’s
1 quick
1 jumped
